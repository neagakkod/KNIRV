        PayPal Platform PHP SDK</h1>
    <h2>
        Overview</h2>
    <p>
        The PayPal's Software Developer Kit (SDK) eases the process of integrating PayPal's
        financial services(WebServices) into your application by providing a core library,
        command line and web samples. This software is intended for use by software developers
        with a basic understanding of the selected platform's language (PHP) and environment.
    </p>
    <b>Features supported by PHP SDK:</b> </br>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Simple Wrapper APIs:</b>
            <p>
            The SDK provides simple APIs to consume AdaptiveAccounts APIs or Web Services. You
            can program to the APIs as though they are local Classes/Objects </li>
        </p>
        <li><b>Client Authentication over SSL:</b>
            <p>
                Two types of API credentials, namely <b>Three Token and Client Auth SSL certificate</b>
                are supported by PayPal. A merchant or application developer should have an appproriate(Typically
                a business type) account created by signing onto PayPal site. After creating an
                account he/she can choose to have either type of the credentials. Every API call
                should be accompanied by the API credentials as part of the HTTP headers. This is
                required in addition to the SSL layer in which the transaction takes place. The
                SDK does the heavy lifting of setting up the SSL context and communication. A property
                file namely <b>paypal_sdk_clientproperties.php </b>is used to configure credentials
                and other properties. The property section explain each properties used by SDK and
                how to configure them in detail.</p>
        </li>
        <li><b>Message protocol independence: </b>
            <p>
                The PayPal Platform WebService APIs support various request and response data bindings
                or payload formats (NV, JSON, XML, and SOAP). However when you use the APIs provided
                by SDK you do not need to care about the payload format.</p>
        </li>
        <li><b>Command line samples and reference implementations:</b>
            <p>
                of PayPal APIs are supplied with the SDK. Please read the respective sections given
                below to know more. Command lines samples are the quickest way to learn the APIs.</p>
        </li>
        <li><b>Proxy/Firewall server Support:</b>
            <p>
                SDK can work with Proxy servers. That is SDK can make API call via proxy server/port
                specified in the paypal_sdk_clientproperties.php file. Please see the file to know
                how to specify it.</p>

        SDK Wrapper APIs</h2>
    <p>
        SDK supports Adaptive Accounts Webservice APIs at the time of writing this. Future
        Version of SDKs may support more APIs. The wrapper APIs and other features simplifies
        the integration of your application with PayPal. Once right API credentials other
        properties like DNS name of the PayPal webservice are defined in property files,
        you can start making API calls and transactions (as shown below) using the sdk artifacts/classes/APIs.
        The SDK provide a simple interface you can program to. It also has other helper
        methods ( such as getResult(), getErrorMessage() ) or APIs to make web programming
        more productive. Please notice the AdaptiveAccounts class supports business methods
        which take String as input parameter. This is to aid web programming.

        <h2>
            Logging</h2>
        <p>
            All requests and respones are logged to paypal_platform.log file using Open Source
            Log Library. To Change the name or location of the log file, you need to replace
            paypal_platform.log in the following line in paypal_sdk_clientproperties.php file,
            define('LOGFILENAME','logs/paypal_platform.log');</p>
        <h2>
            Property Files and Configurations</h2>
        <p>
            In order to make successful web service calls, paypal_sdk_clientproperties.php file
            should contain needed information. Amongst all listed below are most important.
            <ul>
                <li>The API_BASE_ENDPOINT property is another one. By default it is set to https://svcs.sandbox.paypal.com/.
                    Please note the trailing slash at the end. You need to change it to https://svcs.paypal.com/
                    to use against live production server. Otherwise you can test the SDK against sandbox
                    (CRI) without making any changes at all.</li>
                <li>The API credentials section. Specify either 3-token or SSL Client Auth certificate
                    credential details such as API Username, password, and signature or path of the
                    pem file location. The files are already configured to use a common/shared public
                    account against PayPal CRI or sandbox environment. The samples will run as is with
                    out any configuration changes at all. If you are using a proxy server then specify
                    the hostname and port, and other information in the proxy server section of paypal_sdk_clientproperties.php
                    file.</li>
                <li>API_VERSION. You need to set it to right version to take advantage of the corresponding
                    version features</li>
                <li>
                API_AUTHENTICATION_MODE - Set it to 'ssl' if you are using SSL certificate as API
                credential.
            </ul>
            <h2>
                web_constants.php and Configurations</h2>
            <p>
                Any constants being re-used by the web pages go here. Currently two constants which
                define PayPal redirect URL and DeveloperPortal URL are defined in here.
